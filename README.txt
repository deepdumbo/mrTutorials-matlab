These are Matlab functions and scripts that illustrate the properties of basic magnetic resonance and magnetic resonance imaging.  The code is used as part of Psych 204A, a course by Brian Wandell and Robert Dougherty, that introduces cognitive neuroscientists to MR principles.

Robert Dougherty and Michael Waskom are converting these tutorials to Python this year (2012-2013 academic year).  We expect to convert our public tutorials to Python in this class, so that the Matlab version will be deprecated.
