% Author: Wandell
% Purpose:
%    What is the hemodynamic impulse response function (HIRF)?
%    Show what the Heeger function looks like.  Compare it with the
%    Friston/Worsley/SPM function.  Any others?
%    Compute the predicted response, building up from convolution.
%    Do an example of deconvolution.  See if we can show some of the
%    problems with noise sensitivity.
